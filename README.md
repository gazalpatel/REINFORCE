# REINFORCE
The goal of this project is to apply and evaluate the REINFORCE algorithm in solving the CartPole-v0 environment, a classic reinforcement learning task in which a pole is balanced on a moving cart. The algorithm's objective is to enable an agent to learn policies that maximize cumulative rewards by balancing the pole as long as possible.
